# Repository instructions

- This is an independent, paper-guided MemoryWAM reimplementation on FastWAM. Never present it as official MemoryWAM source.
- Preserve FastWAM's Wan-based world-action model and implement only the MemoryWAM/RoboMME changes required by the project plan.
- Classify every MemoryWAM behavior as inherited from FastWAM, specified by the paper, or an explicit implementation inference.
- Treat `/home/ed1116/Projects/robomme_policy_learning` as a clean, read-only interface reference.
- Never modify `/home/ed1116/Projects/robomme_my_attempt`.
- Read raw training data from `/data/ed1116/Datasets/robomme_data_h5` without modifying it.
- Store processed data, checkpoints, and runs under `/data/ed1116/robomme`; never commit them.
- Use FP16 on Quadro RTX 8000. Do not claim BF16 parity, and do not use FlashAttention on this hardware.
- Before each commit, inspect the diff and run the narrow tests for the changed behavior. Push every coherent milestone to `origin`.

# Base instructions

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
